# Python Programs 🐍

* Several Python programs for practice.

### Word Cloud

> The "text_to_wordcloud.py" program reads a text file, generates a word cloud based on its content using the wordcloud library, and displays the resulting image using Matplotlib. The program allows users to easily visualize the most frequently occurring words in a given text, making it useful for tasks such as text analysis and summarization.
