# Python Programs 🐍

* Several Python programs for practice.

### Word Cloud

> The "text_to_wordcloud.py" program reads a text file, generates a word cloud based on its content using the wordcloud library, and displays the resulting image using Matplotlib. The program allows users to easily visualize the most frequently occurring words in a given text, making it useful for tasks such as text analysis and summarization.

### Binary Classification

> This problem involves implementing a simple binary classification model using supervised machine learning techniques. The model uses a sigmoid activation function to predict the class labels of a set of input samples. We are given the input features, weight vector, and true labels for the samples, and we must implement functions to compute the hypothesis value, sigmoid value, and misclassification rate of the model.
